## Blockchain's Evolving Value Proposition

As we all know by now, the original crypto-currency of it's kind was Bitcoin. Bitcoin's white paper original states that it's use case and value proposition is Peer to Peer Cash. I personally feel that Bitcoin in it's current iteration did not really live up to that specific use case.

Not too long after, we see Ethereum, which was branched off and inspired by previous ideas of trying to utilize blockchain technology for other use cases, 1 notable example was [NameCoin](https://www.namecoin.org/) that tried to bring a decentralized DNS with blockchain.

(Ethereum's white paper)[https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/] titles itself as a **A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform**. And as we see the current trends in the crypto currency market, the sheer rise of new platforms whose value proposition is intimately tied to this *Decentralized Application Platform* has been numerous.

## Money as an application on a Decentralized Application Platform

I think with the rise of the dichotomy of blockchains that are exclusively money, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Nano, Dash and blockchains that are more than that, Ethereum, Algorand, Cardano, and Avalanche, I think people might try to categorize blockchains by their use cases.
