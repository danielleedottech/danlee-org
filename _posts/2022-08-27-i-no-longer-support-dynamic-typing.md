## My history with dynamic typing

All of my professional experience involving working exclusively in dynamically typed languages: javascript, ruby, and python. For the longest time, I was a huge fan of dynamically typed languages. I believed their ease of use, concise syntax, and their ability to be flexible was a superior way of maintaining high feature velocity. That was until I started working at my current position.

## Where dynamic typing failed me

At my current role, we work with a lot of data and really big data. We use a Ruby on Rails rest API 


talking points:

* ide debugger methodology
* sending json to front end clients
* automated testing
